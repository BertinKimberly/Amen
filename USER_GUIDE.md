## Audio Studio

### What is Audio Studio?

Audio Studio lets you:
- Import multiple audio files
- Cut precise clips from them and preview each one individually
- Arrange clips across multiple tracks on a timeline
- Move, trim, split, duplicate, and delete clips on the timeline
- Mute/solo individual tracks
- Apply volume, fades, and crossfades
- Undo/redo any editing action
- Export the final mix

Drag the handle between the waveform and the timeline to give either one more
room — Amen remembers your preference.

### Import Audio

**Method 1: File Picker**
1. Go to **Audio Studio** tab
2. Click **Import Audio**
3. Select your audio files (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A)
4. Click Open

**Method 2: Drag and Drop**
1. Go to **Audio Studio** tab
2. Drag audio files from Windows Explorer
3. Drop them on the window
4. They import automatically

**Method 3: From Downloads**
1. Download an MP3 from Home view
2. Go to **History** tab
3. Click the **music note icon** next to your download
4. File opens in Audio Studio automatically

### Create Clips

1. **Select a source** - Click an audio file in the Sources panel
2. **View waveform** - The waveform appears in the center
3. **Select region** - Click and drag on the waveform
4. **Create clip** - Click the **+** button in the Clips section
5. **Done!** - Your clip appears in the Clip Library

**Tip:** You can create multiple clips from the same source.

### Preview a Clip

Before — or instead of — placing a clip on the timeline, you can hear exactly
that clip on its own:

1. Hover over a clip in the **Clip Library**
2. Click the **▶ Preview** icon that appears on it
3. Playback starts at the clip's start and stops exactly at its end
4. The indicator above the player bar reads **CLIP PREVIEW** while this is
   happening, so it's never confused with playing the whole source file

### Arrange on Timeline

1. **Drag a clip** - Click and drag a clip from the Clip Library onto a track
2. **Drop it** - Release over the position where you want it; a drop indicator
   shows exactly where it will land
3. **Move it** - Drag a placed clip left/right to reposition it, or onto
   another track
4. **Trim it** - Drag either edge of a placed clip to shorten it (the
   underlying clip in the library is untouched — this only affects the
   timeline placement)
5. **Split it** - Move the playhead to where you want the cut, select the
   clip, then click **Split** in the timeline toolbar (or press **S**). Both
   halves keep playing the same audio with no gap or fade at the cut, and can
   then be moved, trimmed, or deleted independently
6. **Add more tracks** - Click **+ Track** to layer additional clips
7. **Mute / solo a track** - Use the speaker/S buttons in the track header
8. **Undo/redo** - Every move, trim, split, and delete can be undone
   (Ctrl+Z) and redone (Ctrl+Shift+Z)

### Preview Your Mix

The player bar always shows what it's about to play — **SOURCE**,
**CLIP PREVIEW**, or **TIMELINE MIX** — so it's never ambiguous which one
you're hearing.

1. **Switch to Timeline Mix** - Click **Timeline Mix** in the Playback row
   (Amen renders a preview automatically the first time, and again whenever
   the timeline changes)
2. **Play button** - Click Play in the player bar
3. **Seek** - Click the seek slider, or the timeline ruler, to jump around
4. **Volume** - Adjust volume or mute as needed

### Export Your Mix

1. **Click Export** - Top-right corner
2. **Choose format**:
   - **MP3** - Compressed, good for sharing (choose bitrate)
   - **WAV** - Uncompressed, best quality, large file
   - **FLAC** - Compressed but lossless
   - **M4A** - Modern compressed format
3. **Choose location** - Pick where to save
4. **Click Export** - Wait for completion
5. **Done!** - Your mix is ready

### Save Your Project

Want to come back later?
1. **Click Save** - Saves your project as a .lms file
2. **Choose location** - Save it anywhere
3. **Later:** Click **Open** to reload it

## Tips & Tricks

### Audio Studio Workflow

**Basic Edit:**
```
Import → Select region → Create clip → Add to timeline → Export
```

**Multi-source Mix:**
```
Import 3 files → Create clip from each → Arrange on timeline → Export
```

**Quick Trim:**
```
Import file → Select 30s-45s → Create clip → Export
```

### Best Practices

1. **Name your clips** - Hover a clip in the Clip Library and click the pencil icon to rename it
2. **Duplicate before experimenting** - Clone clips to try different arrangements
3. **Save often** - Projects are small, save multiple versions
4. **Use multiple tracks** - Layer sounds for richer mixes
5. **Preview frequently** - Preview auto-renders, so listen as you go

### Quality Settings

**For MP3 Downloads:**
- **Best** - VBR (variable bitrate), highest quality, ~256-320k average
- **320k** - Maximum constant bitrate, largest file
- **192k** - Good balance, most people can't hear the difference
- **128k** - Smaller files, noticeable quality loss

**For Exports:**
- **WAV** - Use for further editing in other software
- **FLAC** - Best compression without quality loss
- **MP3 320k** - Great for sharing, streaming
- **MP3 192k** - Good for most uses, smaller files
