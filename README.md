# Amen

A beautiful, local-first media downloader for **Windows 11** — powered by **yt-dlp** and **FFmpeg**.

Paste a supported media URL (YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, and the hundreds of extractors yt-dlp
supports), analyze it locally, pick a format and quality, and download. Everything runs on your
machine. There is **no cloud service**, no "online YouTube-to-MP3 website", and no third-party
conversion API — the app shells out to a locally installed `yt-dlp` + `ffmpeg` and streams real
progress back to the UI.

---

## What it does

- **URL → Analyze → Download**, all local.
- **MP3 extraction** (primary): `bestaudio` → FFmpeg → MP3 with selectable output quality
  (Best / 320 / 256 / 192 / 128 kbps).
- **MP4 video** (secondary): best video + audio merged to MP4.
- **Real metadata + album art**: title, artist/uploader, album, date, genre, description and the
  thumbnail are embedded as proper media tags (yt-dlp + FFmpeg do the tagging).
- **Playlist support**: preview entries, select/deselect, download whole playlist or a subset.
- **Download queue** with live progress: percentage, speed, ETA, bytes, current stage,
  cancel / retry / remove / clear finished.
- **Robust duplicate handling**: skip / replace / create a new copy, keyed by stable media ID and
  existing files on disk.
- **Download history** (SQLite) with search, filters, sorting, open file, reveal in Explorer,
  copy source URL, re-download, remove.
- **Settings** for theme, defaults, output directory, filename templates, overwrite behavior,
  executable paths, metadata options, and a few advanced options.
- **Diagnostics screen** that genuinely checks yt-dlp, FFmpeg, ffprobe, the output directory,
  free disk space, and network — and can **auto-install** missing tools from official sources.
- **Structured local logging** with a one-click "copy diagnostic report".

## Security model

- User-provided URLs and metadata are treated as **untrusted input**.
- `yt-dlp`/`FFmpeg` are spawned with **structured argument arrays** — never a shell string.
- Output paths are sanitized (Windows-invalid characters, reserved device names, length caps,
  path-traversal rejection).
- No browser cookie harvesting. Authenticated content is only reachable through an
  **explicitly provided** cookies file in Settings → Advanced, which the user must supply.
- Only **official sources** are used for dependency installation: yt-dlp GitHub releases and
  gyan.dev Windows FFmpeg builds.
- No DRM/paywall/access-control bypass is attempted or supported.

| yt-dlp                                     | Required at runtime; auto-installable from Diagnostics |
| FFmpeg + ffprobe                           | Required at runtime; auto-installable from Diagnostics |

At **runtime** the app only needs yt-dlp and FFmpeg, which it can install for you from the
Diagnostics screen. Development additionally needs Node + Rust.

## Development

```bash
# 1. Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# 2. (Optional) generate icons if you changed scripts/gen-icon.mjs
npm run gen:icon && npx tauri icon src-tauri/icons/icon.png

# 3. Install the Rust toolchain (once)
#    https://rustup.rs — stable profile, MSVC host
#    (requires Visual Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload)

# 4. Run the desktop app in dev mode (hot reload)
npm run tauri:dev
```

> First `tauri:dev` compiles the whole Rust dependency tree — expect several minutes.

> **Low-memory machines (≤ 8 GB RAM):** the project ships `src-tauri/.cargo/config.toml`
> with `jobs = 1` to avoid memory exhaustion. If `rustc` still aborts while compiling the
> huge `windows`/`tauri-utils` crates (Windows error `0xc0000409`, "stack overflow" /
> "memory allocation … failed"), set a large worker-thread stack before building:
>
> ```powershell
> $env:RUST_MIN_STACK = 268435456   # 256 MB — fixes rustc stack overflow
> npm run tauri:dev
> ```

## Production build (Windows installer)

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri:build
```

The installer is written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`
(`Amen_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`). It is a per-user NSIS installer and does not require
admin rights.

## Production build (Linux packages)

Requires **Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+** — Tauri v2 needs WebKitGTK **4.1**, and
Ubuntu 22.04 and older only ship 4.0. From Windows, build inside WSL:

```bash
wsl -d Ubuntu -u root -- bash /mnt/c/path/to/amen/scripts/build-linux.sh
```

`scripts/build-linux.sh` installs the toolchain, runs the Rust tests, builds, and
copies the results into `dist-linux/`. To build natively on Linux, run the same
script directly.

The packages link against the glibc of the machine that builds them, so build on
the **oldest** distribution you intend to support: a package built on 24.04 will
not start on 22.04.

### Installing

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu — pulls in ffmpeg automatically
sudo apt install ./Amen_0.2.0_amd64.deb

# Or the portable AppImage, which needs no installation
chmod +x Amen_0.2.0_amd64.AppImage
./Amen_0.2.0_amd64.AppImage
```

The `.deb` declares `ffmpeg` as a dependency, so apt installs it for you. The
AppImage does not, so install FFmpeg yourself if you use it:
`sudo apt install ffmpeg`. In both cases yt-dlp is fetched on demand from the
Diagnostics screen.

## yt-dlp & FFmpeg setup

The app **auto-detects** each tool in this order:

1. A path explicitly configured in **Settings → yt-dlp & FFmpeg**.
2. A **bundled** copy in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Amen\tools`.
3. An executable found on your **PATH**.

If a tool is missing, open **Diagnostics** and click **Install both** — the app downloads
`yt-dlp.exe` from the official GitHub releases and the FFmpeg essentials build from gyan.dev,
extracts them into the tools folder, and re-checks.

Manual installation (equivalent):

```powershell
# yt-dlp via pip (needs Python)
py -m pip install -U yt-dlp

# or the standalone exe (official)
# download https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.exe
# into a folder on your PATH

# FFmpeg (official Windows builds)
# download https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip
# extract and add the bin folder to PATH (or point to it in Settings)
```

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\Amen\settings.json`. Download history and the
persisted queue live in `%APPDATA%\Amen\history.db`. Logs are in
`%APPDATA%\Amen\logs\app.log`.

Defaults:

- Output directory: `%USERPROFILE%\Music\Amen`
- Filename template: `%(title)s.%(ext)s` (yt-dlp syntax — subdirectories like
  `%(artist)s/%(album)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s` are supported)
- Format: MP3 · Quality: Best · Overwrite: Skip · Duplicates: Skip
- Artwork and metadata embedding: on · Concurrent downloads: 3

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                               | Fix                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "yt-dlp is not installed"             | Open **Diagnostics** and install it (or add it to PATH and re-check).                                                                |
| "FFmpeg is missing"                   | Install from **Diagnostics**. ffmpeg and ffprobe ship together.                                                                      |
| "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" | YouTube's anti-bot gate. If you are authorized to access the content, provide a cookies file in **Settings → Advanced** (see below). |
| Video unavailable / 403               | The content is private, removed, age-restricted, or region-blocked.                                                                  |
| Files land in the wrong folder        | Change the output directory in **Settings → Downloads**.                                                                             |
| Nothing helps                         | **Diagnostics → Copy report** and inspect the logs folder.                                                                           |

### Cookies file (advanced, deliberate)

For authenticated/age-gated content you are _authorized_ to access, export a cookies file
(e.g. with a browser extension that exports Netscape-format cookies) and set its path in
**Settings → Advanced → Cookies file**. The app only ever passes the file path to yt-dlp with
`--cookies` — it never reads your browser's cookies automatically.

## Security notes

- Subprocesses are spawned with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` and argument arrays; no shell interpolation.
- Output filenames are sanitized and length-capped; `..` traversal is rejected.
- The download manager kills entire process trees on cancel/close (no orphan FFmpeg processes).
- Downloaded metadata is treated as data — it is never executed.
- Diagnostic reports redact the cookies file path.

## Testing

### Unit tests (no network)

```bash
npm test                    # frontend: URL handling, formatting
cd src-tauri && cargo test  # backend: sanitization, progress parsing, args, errors
```

### Integration / end-to-end (real yt-dlp + FFmpeg + network)

The Rust integration tests in `src-tauri/src/integration_tests.rs` run the **real pipeline**:
metadata fetch → argument generation → actual MP3 download → ffprobe verification (container,
codec, duration, embedded tag). They are `#[ignore]`d by default:

```powershell
# put your tools somewhere the test can find them, then:
$env:LMS_TOOLS_DIR = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Amen\tools"   # or your PATH
$env:LMS_TEST_URL   = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc"  # optional
cd src-tauri
cargo test -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

These tests use **Big Buck Bunny** (Blender Foundation's open movie, Creative Commons) — a
publicly available clip that is appropriate for testing download tooling. The E2E test verifies
the real pipeline: metadata extraction → argument generation → actual yt-dlp download → FFmpeg
conversion → ffprobe verification (container, codec, duration, embedded tags).

### Studio end-to-end tests (Playwright, against the real running app)

`tests/*.spec.ts` drive the actual running desktop app's WebView2 instance via Chrome DevTools
Protocol — not a plain browser tab, so `invoke()`-backed features (waveform extraction, mixing,
export, project save/load) are exercised for real, never mocked. Requires the app to already be
running with remote debugging enabled:

```powershell
$env:WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS = "--remote-debugging-port=9222"
npm run tauri:dev
```

Then, in another terminal:

```bash
npx playwright test              # full suite
npx playwright test tests/studio-undo-redo.spec.ts   # a single file
```

The realistic-duration performance tests (`tests/studio-performance.spec.ts`) need three
multi-minute fixtures that are regenerated locally rather than committed (100+ MB, reproducible
in seconds):

```powershell
powershell -File tests/fixtures/generate-fixtures.ps1
```

## Updating

- **yt-dlp**: Diagnostics → "Check for updates". The app compares against the official GitHub
  release API and can self-update the bundled copy via `yt-dlp -U`.
- **FFmpeg**: re-run the Diagnostics install (it overwrites the bundled binaries).
- **The app itself**: rebuild with `npm run tauri:build` and run the new installer.
